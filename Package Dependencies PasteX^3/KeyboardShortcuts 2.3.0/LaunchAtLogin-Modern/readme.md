# LaunchAtLogin

> Add ‚ÄúLaunch at Login‚Äù functionality to your macOS app in seconds

This package is meant for apps targeting macOS 13 or later. If you need backwards-compatibility, check out the old [`LaunchAtLogin` package](https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin).

## Requirements

macOS 13+

## Install

Add `https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin-Modern` in the [‚ÄúSwift Package Manager‚Äù tab in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

## Usage

Put the toggle in your `Settings` scene. That's it.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import LaunchAtLogin

@main
struct MyApp: App {
	var body: some Scene {
		Settings {
			Form {
				LaunchAtLogin.Toggle()
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The `LaunchAtLogin.Toggle` view works similarly to the built-in `Toggle` except that is has a predefined binding and label.

The default label is `"Launch at login"`, but it can be overridden:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import LaunchAtLogin

struct SettingsScreen: View {
	var body: some View {
		LaunchAtLogin.Toggle("Launch at login ü¶Ñ")

		// Or
		LaunchAtLogin.Toggle {
			Text("Launch at login ü¶Ñ")
		}
	}
}
```

You can also access the state directly:

```swift
import LaunchAtLogin

print(LaunchAtLogin.isEnabled)
//=> false

LaunchAtLogin.isEnabled = true

print(LaunchAtLogin.isEnabled)
//=> true
```

## Note

The [Mac App Store guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) require ‚Äúlaunch at login‚Äù functionality to be enabled in response to a user action. Your app will be rejected if you set the state to true by default.

## FAQ

### How is this different from the old package?

This is a new repo as the old package had a lot of bloat in its Git history. I also took the opportunity to make a more minimal API optimized for SwiftUI apps.
